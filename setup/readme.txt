kbdlk 1.2.0.0 - United States-DEC LKxxx-style Keyboard Layout
=============================================================

Run setup.exe to install. Use "Add or Remove Programs" or setup.exe again to uninstall.

The keyboard layout will automatically be added to the language bar on install and removed on uninstall.

A reboot is necessary when installing different versions. This seems to work:
1) Uninstall old version
2) Install new version
3) Reboot for new version to be used.
